# milestone_one

The first milestone is to use what you learned in lessons 1 through 4 ( and maybe a bit more) to create a simple game that has the player move the square block from a marked start location to a marked end location. Once the player gets to the end location, the program should let the player know that they won, and how much time it took for them to win. I have set the deadline for this milestone to be 11:59PM on January 9, 2016. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure to have clear and descriptive comments in your code, because each milestone will be built based on the last. After each milestone, I will select a member's code ( maybe at random), and we will all use the selected code to build upon in the next milestone. This will help practice reading other developers' code, and writing comments for others to learn from. 

In the real world of software engineering, rarely is software developed from scratch. Most likely, we will be adding to and/or modifying existing code someone else wrote.
