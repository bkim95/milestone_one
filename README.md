# milestone_one

The first milestone is to use what you learned in lessons 1 through 4 ( and maybe a bit more) to create a simple game that has the player move the square block from a marked start location to a marked end location. Once the player gets to the end location, the program should let the player know that they won, and how much time it took for them to win. I have set the deadline for this milestone to be 11:59PM on January 9, 2016.
